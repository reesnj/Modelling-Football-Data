# The Application of Statistical Models to the 2019/20 English Premier League Football Season
## Author: Nathan Rees (784823)

A collection of R scripts to support a final year Mathematics project, interested in applying statistical models to EPL football data.

The analysis is split into two sections. 
The first section strives to construct a model to predict the probability of a home win, using logistic regression. The raw data, R script, and outputs can all be found within the folder titles "logistic_regression".
The second section applies survival analysis techniques to investigate the time taken to score the first goal in a football match. Likewise, the raw data, R script, and outputs can all be found within the folder titles "survival_analysis".
